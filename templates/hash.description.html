{{_("Isn't is great to have examples? Our is about one gang. The gang has 5 members:
<ul>
<li>Janez Korenina</li>
<li>Zala Novak</li>
<li>Miha Copatar</li>
<li>Zvonko Nagode</li>
<li>Tone Rastlina</li>
</ul><br><br>The gang members never call each other by name! Why? <br> 
Well, you know the gang, always in want to hide something... And if there
 is no eyes, ears are everywhere. So, they decided to give themself code 
names. Imagine, they call each other only by initials (!WOW!). This way, 
knowing that ZN did something, does not tell us who really did it. It 
could be Zrinka Novakovič or Zvonimir Nikša or Zlata Nikšić, who knows 
?!?! <br> <small>Disclamer: No one outside the gang  knows who is in the 
gang.</small> <br> <br> Let us now observe the rule that transforms name 
of the gang member into the code name. Well, it is actually one example 
of the hash function. Let's denote it with 
<code>F()</code>.<br><br>Buuut, does it really have all abovementioned 
properties? ")}}

{{_("Is <code>F()</code> really a mathematiacal hash function

transformed into JK.</li><li>But, property 2 does not, i.e. Zala Novak 
and Zvonko Nagode transform into the same code name: ZNThe probability 
that the collision happens within the gang of 5 is lower than 1,6 
percentage which is pretty much in a world of hash functions, as to be 
hit by the meteor is 0.000001 percentage.Unfortunatelly for the gang, 
this probability rises as new people comes to the gang. When the gang is 
of size 20, the same probability is 26,5 percentage. </li><li>Property 3 
holds. At least that! The gang should be happy that their code namesare 
always of length 2.</li><li>Property 4 does not hold inside the gang, 
e.g. when saying ZN,the gang knows that that must be Zala Novak. But 
outside the gang it is holds pretty well!! Both suits the gang pretty 
well.</ul>")}}

{{_("So, <code>F()</code> suits the purpose for the gang (as long as
	they are small gang),  but it is not a real mathemathical hash
	function.If Zdravka Najc become member, they get COLLISION. Now, when
	talking about ZN, no one knows who they are talking about. Not even them.
	 Pretty bad. A solution? Lucky for them, there is always some solution,
	just waiting around the corner. Smart guys invented some pretty MEAN hash
	 functions, i.e. SHA-512, Bcrypt etc. <br><br>Beside for gang-bussines,
	where else can we use hash functions? Are they used at all? Ofcourse. Let
	 us list JUST some.<ul><li>Saving data in a (hash) table. Now, when
	searching the table, we just search for corresponding hash. – Insted for
	searching row by row, for some long name or so, calculating the hash of
	it provides us with (almost) instant reference to the data we want. This
	is explained in 'programming' language. If you do not understand it, it
	is fine :) No one does for real.</li><li>Checking if two inputs are the
	same. - Imagine having two documents of at least 50 pages. You want to
	check if they are not equal, and after a day, two, three, you conclude
	that they actually ARE NOT!! The only difference is the last word. What a
	 wast of time. Expecially when there is an easier way. You could have
	done this but only calculating the hash of each. So, if they are not
	equal, you have your statement! :).<br> As the smallest change in the
	input should have change the output. Furthermore, if two hashes turn out
	identical, we usually conclude that the input was the same as well. This
	is actually used during the file transfer process.</li><li>Storing
	posswords. - In a case of having a portal with a registration, to keep
	VERY passwords secret (even to you). You never store actual passwords ,
	but need to still be able to check it the user name maches the password.
	Insted of the password, you only store password-hashes. Ofcourse, each
	hash is stored together with corresponding username. <br>This way, if
	anyone attacks aour storage, it will not be able to obtain passwords as
	there are none. This makes users happy. (At least until they forget their
	 password).</li> </ul>")}}
